# CSS Concat
This module is not intended to do any minification or compression. It's just supposed to concatenate @imported CSS files together and doing it properly. This applies to the relative paths to images as well.

While npm isn't needed for this module to work, I highly recommend it - it makes managing your modules and it's dependencies very comfortable.

## Installation

    npm install -g css-concat

## From command-line
CSS Concat reads from `input.css` and writes to `output.css`. If you don't specify `output.css` explicitly, it will write to `input-out.css`. Options currently only consist of `--no-comments`, which will disable automatic generation of comments - this will _not_ strip comments from the source files!

    css-concat [input.css] ([output.css] [options])

## From another node-module
Calling concat with the path to your CSS file, you will get a string containing the same output as the command-line version. By default, comments are enabled - to disable them just pass along the appropriate options object.

	var cssConcat    = require('css-concat'),
		options      = { comments : true },
		outputString = cssConcat.concat('path/to/your.css', options);
